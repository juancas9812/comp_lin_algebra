# comp_lin_algebra

This is the repo for the Computational Linear Algebra section of the equinox plan semilla for data science.

Contents:
[MNIST_PCA.ipynb](MNIST_PCA.ipynb): code for PCA applied to MNIST dataset and visualizing over the first 2 components
[MNIST_PCA_MDS_TSNE.ipynb](MNIST_PCA_MDS_TSNE.ipynb): code for different types of dimensionality reduction applied to the MNIST dataset
[Movie_recommendation.ipynb](Movie_recommendation.ipynb): code for basic recommender system using SVD (There are errors as the final operation is wrong, must do correction!)
[SVD_image_compression.ipynb](SVD_image_compression.ipynb): code for image compression using singular value decomposition (the compression is in terms of data inside the image matrix, not in the image file)
[SVD_audio_compression.ipynb](SVD_audio_compression.ipynb): code for audio compression using SVD (the compression is in terms of data inside the audio matrix, not in the audio file)
